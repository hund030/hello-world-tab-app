# Teams Toolkit v5.0 Pre-release

### What does pre-release mean?

Pre-release is meant for those who are eager to try the latest Teams Toolkit features and fixes. Even though pre-releases are not intended for use in production, they are at a sufficient quality level for you to generally use and [provide feedback](https://aka.ms/ttk-feedback). However, pre-release versions can and probably will change, and those changes could be major.

We've addressed a number of reported bugs and added major changes in this release based on your feedback to make Teams Toolkit more flexible. Some of the key highlights to these changes include:

- Use existing infrastructure, resource groups, and more when provisioning
- Use an existing Teams app ID
- Use an existing Azure AD app registration ID
- Use a different tunneling solution or customize the defaults
- Add custom steps to debugging, provisioning, deploying, publishing, etc.

### What about my existing Teams Toolkit projects?

The changes in this pre-release require upgrades to the TeamsFx configuration files. We recommend that you create a new app using this version. In the future, we'll provide a way to automatically upgrade existing Teams apps that were created with a previous version of Teams Toolkit.

Learn more about the changes in this pre-release at [https://aka.ms/teamsfx-v5.0-guide](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-v5.0-guide).

# How to use this Teams Tab app HelloWorld app

> Important: Please be advised that access tokens are stored in sessionStorage for you by default. This can make it possible for malicious code in your app (or code pasted into a console on your page) to access APIs at the same privilege level as your client application. Please ensure you only request the minimum necessary scopes from your client application, and perform any sensitive operations from server side code that your client has to authenticate with.

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version after 1.55 or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code.
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From TeamsFx CLI: Start debugging the project by executing the command `teamsfx preview --env local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `./appPackage` folder. The folder contains one manifest file:

- `manifest.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally or running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

This file contains template arguments with `${{...}}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.

## Deploy to Azure

Deploy your project to Azure by following these steps:

| From Visual Studio Code                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | From TeamsFx CLI                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
